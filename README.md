This repository is used to display the different lab assignments in the class CSE 120 Intro to programming with Python

Lab 1:
  This introduces the basic concepts of programing in Python. This program calculates the area of a trapezoid and prints out the value
  
Lab 2:
  1) This introduces the concepts of getting user inputs and iteratating though lists and for loops.
  2) This program asks the user for a city and then iterateses through a list of cities, ordered by their population size largest to smallest, and prints out cities smaller than the           user provided city
Lab 3:
  1) This lab introduces the concepts of intersections, unions, ect of lists
  2) This program prompts the user to enter a list of their ingredients. It then compares the user made list with a list of ingredients use to make soup and salad. The program then           tells the user if they are able to make salads, soups, or both items.
Lab 4:
  1) This lab introduces the concepts of objects and functions in python.
  2) This program asks the user for how much money they have. The program then tells the user how many of each bill and coin they could have in their wallet. The program prioritizes           outputting the greatest number of the largest bill and then decreases the bill amount.
Lab 5:
  1) This lab introduces the concepts of recursion and functions.
  2) This program asks the user which decimal number they would like to convert. Then using recursion the program displays the binary equivalent of the decimal number.
